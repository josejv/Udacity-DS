## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Python 3.11.5 was used while preparing this project. However, the code should run without issues using versions 3.* and no libraries beyond standard ones shall be needed. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This project aims to answer the following questions

1. Do register reviewers feel overall content with the accomodation they found in Airbnb? 
2. Is the price listed by the host reasonable enough for what he offers?
3. How can we forecast the listing price of a property? 

All files needed to understand the conclusions are available [here](https:// ... myfancy repo)
